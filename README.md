# Drum Machine

This is a freeCodeCamp certification challenge.

While I have learned many things from creating this challenge, I would handle Audio entirely differently. Using AudioBuffers would allow for more granular control over the sounds being produced. This is not allowed since the tests require the use of an HTMLAudioElement. Requiring manipulation to be done through MediaElement instead. A less verbose API for sound controls

*NOTE*: Sustain must be on to pass test, as does show file name.
